# F18-Altimeter

I've opened the Altimeter code to the public.  It's not complete and I'm not happy with the barameter just yet. It still needs some work.
My 1st attempt, I coded the gauge to work like an automotive odometer and it worked great!  then, I realized the drums on the altimeter rotate in the opposite direction. I then recreated the graphics to make the neccessary changes and I'm still working on the code so its display matches DCS.
