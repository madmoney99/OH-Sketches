The usb connectors will interfere with the test, and Cage/Uncage knob so I've implemented the display mounted upside down.
I believe this should allow for the display and electorics to clear the Open Hornet frame without interference.
I cannnot confirm this since I cannot print the frame with my 3d printer. The bed is not large enough.

Having the display mounter upside down challenges my thinkinng when working with the screen coordinates, so that's been fun!
