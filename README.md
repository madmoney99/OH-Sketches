 OH Cockpit Sketches

These were designed roughly using the OH interconnect plan but may deviate based on some personal changes in wiring or switch layout from the official Open Hornet specification.  Boards.txt has been modified to allow for HID identification by board, but again , tthis isn't to any written OH spec, done purely based on my limited experience of programming Arduino and USB devices.
