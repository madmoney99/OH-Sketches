    Library Installation: Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can find Adafruit_TCA9534 in the Arduino Library Manager or install it from the Adafruit GitHub repository. The HID-Project library is used for HID functionality.

    Button Mapping: The example code sends keyboard key presses based on the button indices. Adjust the Keyboard.press() and Keyboard.release() functions as needed to match your HID report requirements.

    Button States: This code assumes that a button press results in a LOW signal. If your hardware behaves differently, adjust the condition in bitRead(buttonStates, j) == LOW accordingly.

    HID Report Customization: Depending on your HID device type (keyboard, joystick, etc.), you may need to customize the HID report generation part of the code.

This sketch provides a basic framework for reading button states from multiple TCA9534 devices and sending HID reports based on those states. Adjust and expand it as necessary for your specific application and hardware setup.
